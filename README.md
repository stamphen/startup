# A Journal for the Whole Family!

[Link to notes.md](notes.md)

## startup specification
### Elevator Pitch
```Journaling has always been hard for me, mostly because it takes so much time. Plus I doubt anyone else is every going to read what I write. What if I could solve both of those problems at once? I want to create a website where families or friends can journal together. There will be different pages for different events (say a family vacation) where people can add stories and memories. Since everyone is sharing, you don't have to write very much, and it's super easy to share with others! Both of the problems solved!```

### Key Features:
- Secure login over HTTPS
- The ability to add comments and stories to the page. 
- Displays the comments and stories others add in realtime.
- Displays who made each comment.
- Displays how many people are on the page at once. 
- Ability to change title of page and add new pages.


### Webpage Design


### Technologies:

- **HTML** - Uses HTML for the structure of the application. Will have one page for logging in and one page for adding comments. 
- **CSS** - 
- **JavaScript** - 
- **Service** - 
- **DB/Login** - 
- **WebSocket** - 
- **React** - 




















#### Authentication:
I will have each family member create an account. This will make sure that you can only add stories and pictures to the pages you've been invited to.
#### Database Data:

#### WebSocket Data:
This will be real-time messages and comments from other family members.

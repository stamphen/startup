## From GitHub intro assignment
### List of helpful Git functions:
    - git init (create git repository in the directory you're in)
    - git clone url (copy url from github, creates a repository in the directory that is linked to the one on github)
    - git pull (pulls changes from github, can us git fetch to link github without changing anything)
    + git push (pushes local changes up to the github repository)
    - git add (stages a change, ready to be committed)
    - git add . (stages all changes)
    - git commit ([-m] to write a message [-am] to write message and not have to stage changes)
    - git status (checks how everything is going, and gives you info)
    - git checkout [branch] (lets you work on different branches -- this has been really confusing to me, and I need to work on it)
